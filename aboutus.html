        VYOM is a student-made project that explains the basics of astronomy in plain,
        easy-to-understand language. It covers planets, stars, galaxies, and common space
        phenomena using clear text and simple visuals. The aim is to make learning about
        the sky feel approachable, not overwhelming, for anyone curious about space.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each article and planet guide on VYOM is written with beginners in mind. We break
        down complicated ideas into short sections, use everyday examples, and include
        labeled images to help readers build a clear mental picture. The site focuses on
        giving solid, trustworthy explanations without unnecessary jargon.
      </p>

      <p>
        VYOM is also a learning lab: think of it as a small classroom on the web where
        students can read, explore, and form their own questions about the universe. The
        content is created with care and checked for accuracy, so readers can rely on it as
        a starting point for further study.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our hope is that VYOM sparks curiosity and makes space science useful and
        enjoyable. Whether you are a high school student, a hobbyist, or someone who has
        always looked up and wondered, VYOM aims to guide you step by step into the story
        of the cosmos.
